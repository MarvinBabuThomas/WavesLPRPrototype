This project is a Proof of Concept for a License Plate Recognition developed for Waves Car Wash Braddon. 

This is an Embedded Systems Project designed to do the following:

1) Capture image automatically when an Infra Red Sensor is activated
2) Upload the captured image to OpenALPR Server for Image Processing
3) Receive the processed car details
4) Send the received car details to Waves Car Wash's POS.
