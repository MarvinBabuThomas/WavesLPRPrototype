# WavesLPRPrototype 

This project is a Proof of Concept for a License Plate Recognition developed for Waves Car Wash Braddon. 

This is an Embedded Systems Project designed to do the following:

1) Utlitize a Raspberry PI for computing
2) Takes Picture Automatically when an IR Sensor is activated
3) Uploads the Picture to OpenALPR Server 
4) Receives the processed Car Details
5) Feeds the Car Info to Waves Car Wash's POS.
